## Exchange Rates
A simple application built using vanilla JS, with exchange rate data fetched from fixer.io

Shows exchange rates from EUR to GBP, USD and CAD - along with the fluctuation from the previous day*

*Limitations from the free version of fixer.io's API means that the fluctuations are dummy values hardcoded into the JS file, though the indicator icons are still coded to reflect the fluctuation values should these change.

The app is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: **https://ksells99.github.io/exchange-rates**
